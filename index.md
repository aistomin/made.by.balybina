## Welcome to made.by.balybina
Hi, my name is Sviatlana!
This page is about Quiet Book. So you'll probably see here a bunch of [tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr2wmVAEZTZx45jpburhVRnt9rGNgzhGV) about how to make it,  and [reviews](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr2wmVAEZTZxRYKseXi4LT7djDj--kDd1) of my finished books. Enjoy it!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/balybina/hello-world-course/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/balybina/hello-world-course/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
